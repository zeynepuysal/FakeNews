# FakeNews
An algorithm that loads datasets to be used in the Fake News Detection application.
"You can access the original version of the algorithm at this link: https://github.com/KaiDMML/FakeNewsNet."

Fake News Detection Algorithm
This repository contains the modified version of the Fake News Detection algorithm. The original algorithm and its dataset are sourced from the following works: link: [https://github.com/KaiDMML/FakeNewsNet](https://github.com/KaiDMML/FakeNewsNet

Modifications
Along with my collaborator, Gamze Ka≈üyol, I have corrected several errors in the original algorithm. The updated version is now available for use.

Recommendations Before Use
Library Versions: The requirements.txt file includes the versions of libraries that need to be installed. Some versions may be deprecated; therefore, installing the nearest available version may resolve potential issues.

API Key: You need to obtain an API key from X Developer to connect with X. This will allow you to fetch relevant tweets. Without this, you will only have access to news articles.

Data Generation: Once the algorithm is successfully executed, a new dataset file will be created. This dataset will categorize news articles collected from Politifact and GossipCop, along with their corresponding tweets and the profile information of the users sharing those tweets, under "fake" and "real" headings. Thus, you will have access to both fake and real datasets.

If you use the dataset, you must cite the following references:

The usage of these datasets is entirely up to you!

Special Thanks: I would like to express my gratitude to the original authors of the algorithm for their valuable work.
